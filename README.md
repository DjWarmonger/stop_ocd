# Block closed tabs for a designated amount of time

Having problem with compulsive web browsing? Keep scrolling for news when there are just none? Stop OCD is a solution.

Once all the visible tabs of specific website / domain are closed, the site will remain blocked for a number of minutes (hours) configured in extension setting. So you won't be able to come back.

At the same time, if you do read an interesting article or perform some task on the website, the plugin will let you stay indefinitely. No interruptions in a middle of your work.

## Configuration

* Open extension settings or navigate to `chrome://extensions`
* Find Stop OCD plugin, click `details`
* Click `extension settings`
* Add urls of your nemesis websites. By default, the entire domain will be blocked, but you can specify exact web address too - choose `Block type` -> `Exact URL`.

## Extra

Plugin will synchronize with your other devices if you are logged to Chrome and have synchronization enabled.
